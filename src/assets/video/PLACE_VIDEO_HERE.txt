NOTE: Video files should be placed in public/video/ folder, not here!

The correct location for your video is:
valentine-envelope/public/video/montage.mp4

Why public/ folder?
- Large files like videos should not be processed by Vite bundler
- Files in public/ are served directly as static assets
- Better performance for large media files

For production:
1. Add your montage.mp4 file to public/video/ directory
2. Use H.264 codec for best compatibility
3. Include audio in the video file
4. Optimize file size (recommended < 100MB)
